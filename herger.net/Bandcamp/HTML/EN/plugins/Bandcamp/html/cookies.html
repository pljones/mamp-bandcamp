	<h3>How to get to the web Identity Cookie</h3>
	<p>
		The identity cookie gives you access to resource which otherwise would not be available to you.
		Unfortunately getting a cookie out of a browser is a bit of manual work. But we'll get you there.
		Finding the identity cookie is different for each browser.
	</p>

	<p>
		First of all you'll have to sign in to <a href="https://bandcamp.com" target="_blank">bandcamp.com</a> with your account.
		For Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers, right-click on your browser window, and then click "Inspect" to open the developer console.
		Choose the "Application" tab (Chrome) or the "Storage" tab (Firefox and Safari), select "Cookies", and click on the domain "bandcamp.com".
